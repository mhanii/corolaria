Fix conversation-RAG issue:
	- Initially the agent is prompted to answer a specific question. He answers it using the provided context (eg. a, b ,c).
	- The user asks a clarification or something like "estas seguro" (are you sure)
	- The agent gets a new context (eg. d, e ,f) and says that he was wrong and apologizes for its mistake.
	- This should't happen, but I am yet to find a solution for it
